# Homes-Exam
 Softuni Wordpress Course Final Exam 2023

 This is a project that I have built for Softuni Wordpress Exam on 30th April 2023.

 The project is about home properties.
 It contents a custom WordPress theme and a custom WordPress plugin for creating a home borad website. 

 The project has a custom theme that has a page template displaying the recent homes. In the custom theme the project has separate parts for the page header and page footer. There are a header and footer menues as well. There is also dynamic single page for each property. In the theme there are also custom archive pages for years and for authors. For good user expirience there is 404 page with embeded search form.

 The project has a plugin that takes care of creating the custom post type. There are two custom taxonomies - for location and for seller of the 
 property. In the plugin functionality there is count of visits functionality and also like functionality. The number of likes are displaying 
 through the AJAX. There are also shortcodes for home details and homes lists. In the plugin there is also the content filter, it adds the tweet functionality to each post for good integration with social medias.

 Steps to install:

 * clone the project
 * create a database locally
 * upload the database
 * create your local wp-config.php file
